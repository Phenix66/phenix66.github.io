      <description>Basics Types Virus Can copy itself to infect a computer Infects files on USBs, CDs, network drives, etc to spread Worm Primarily replicate on networks Typically do not require any user interaction Trojan Embedded in other applications Not self-replicating Requires a user to execute infected program User-mode Rootkit Unix: Modified executables or wrapper scripts are used to hide malicious activity from the output of certain commands, such as netstat Windows: Intercept a user&amp;rsquo;s system calls and modify the information returned Kernel-mode Rootkit Often a driver or kernel library Can hide processes, files, directories, and network connections Backdoor Allow for remote access to infected system 2 types Listening Beacon (reverse connection) Dropper Install malware on a target Typically self-delete upon completion 2 types Single-stage: Contains the malware to be installed in the same package as the dropper Stager: The dropper downloads the malware from somewhere else Keylogger Captures all typed input Flooders (DDoS) Generates massive amounts of network traffic to cause a DoS Distributed Reflective Denial of Service (DRDoS) SYN packets are sent with a spoofed source IP to legitimate servers Logic Bomb Performs malicious function after certain conditions are met Non-malicious versions are &amp;ldquo;Easter Eggs&amp;rdquo; Network Sniffer Allow capturing and examination of network traffic Spyware Collects information about a user and transmits it somewhere on the Internet Adware Popup ads Scareware Attempts to get a user to perform some action by convincing them their computer is infected Browser Malware Installed as plugins or extensions, aka Browser Helper Objects May be installed by surfing to an infected website or included with a 3rd-party program installation Spam Unsolicited email Phishing The process of attempting to fraudulently obtain sensitive user information Typically use legitimate looking emails to get a user to click a malicious link Botnets Collection of bots (zombies) Spread with worm functionality Communication IRC Bots contact a central chat server to receive commands HTTP Bots check specific web pages for embedded commands May also use FB, Twitter, etc P2P Decentralized Windows Malware Analysis Research (Internet) Look into suspicious files names Use a sandbox environment Download executables Find DLLs Inspect open file handles Check common registry locations Find ports listening for network communications Inspect suspicious timestamps Check for unsigned files Verify file hashes Check for promiscuous mode Use a hex editor Dump the memory Report your findings Analyzing Useful commands strings handle hexeditor &amp;lt;output_file&amp;gt;Unpack an exe</description>

      <description>Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) What is it: Domain names can use international characters that look like other English characters. Used commonly on phishing sites to further trick a user into thinking they are on a legitimate site. Displaying all domains in their &amp;ldquo;punycode&amp;rdquo; equivalents however prevents this entirely.
In-depth reads: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/03/look-alike-domains-and-visual-confusion/
Browsers that show punycode by default: Chrome Safari Internet Explorer Edge
Mozilla Firefox:
Navigate to &amp;ldquo;about:config&amp;rdquo; Set &amp;ldquo;network.IDN_show_punycode&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; Pastejacking What is it: Allows a website to copy custom text/code to the clipboard when the user copies something else from the site.</description>
